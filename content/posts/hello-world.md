Welcome to my Hugo blog! This is my first post. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an amazing static site generator.

## Features

This blog supports:

- **Markdown formatting**
- Images (just add them to the `static/images/` folder)
- Custom fonts (easily customizable in the CSS)
- <span class="tooltip">Interactive tooltips<span class="tooltiptext">Hover over text to see additional information!</span></span>

## Adding Images

To add images, place them in the `static/images/` directory and reference them like this:

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/your-image.jpg)
```

## Custom Styling

The theme is designed to be lightweight and easily customizable. You can modify the CSS in the `baseof.html` template to change fonts, colors, and layout.
