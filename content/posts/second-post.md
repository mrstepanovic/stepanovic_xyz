This is my second blog post. It will appear in the regular posts section since it's not pinned.

## Regular Post

This post demonstrates how regular (non-pinned) posts appear on the homepage. They show up in the "Latest Posts" section below any pinned posts.

You can create as many posts as you want, and they'll automatically appear on the homepage in chronological order.
