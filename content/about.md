Hi! I'm Mike Stepanovic. 

This is my personal blog where I explore ideas, share experiences, and write about technology and life. I believe in clear thinking and simple communication.

When I'm not writing, you can find me working on various projects or exploring new concepts that catch my curiosity.

You can use this <span class="tooltip">interactive tooltip<span class="tooltiptext">This is an example of a hover tooltip!</span></span> feature for additional context in your posts.
