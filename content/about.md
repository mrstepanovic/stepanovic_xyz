Hi! I'm Mike Stepanovic. 

This is my personal blog where I explore ideas, share experiences, and write about technology and life. I believe in clear thinking and simple communication.

When I'm not writing, you can find me working on various projects or exploring new concepts that catch my curiosity.

You can use this  feature for additional context in your posts.

### More about the site

I built this site with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Claude Sonnet 4](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet) in a couple afternoons. You are reading the beautiful [Reforma](https://www.pampatype.com/reforma) typeface – a Creative Commons font originally designed for the Universidad Nacional de Córdoba in Argentina. *¡Vamos!*

Under the hood, stepanovic.xyz runs on vanilla HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript for <span class="tooltip">interactivity<span class="tooltiptext">Cool, huh?</span></span>. The whole thing is hosted on GitHub Pages and automatically deploys whenever I push new content. You can find it all on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mrstepanovic/stepanovic_xyz).
